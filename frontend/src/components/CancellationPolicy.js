                1. Order Cancellation Before Dispatch You can cancel your order
                without any charges before it has been dispatched. If you wish
                to cancel an order: Contact Us Promptly: Please contact our
                customer support team as soon as possible after placing your
                order. Email: [support@rehobothstore.com] Phone: [Your Contact
                Number] Provide Order Details: Include your order number and
                reason for cancellation to help us process your request quickly.
                If the cancellation request is received before the order is
                dispatched, we will process the cancellation and issue a full
                refund. Refunds will be processed to your original method of
                payment within [number of days, typically 5-10 business days].

              <div class="msoshdndndsf">
                2. No Cancellation After Dispatch Once your order has been
                dispatched, it is no longer eligible for cancellation. Dispatch
                usually occurs within [number of hours, typically 24-48 hours]
                after the order is placed, depending on the product and
                availability. Shipping Confirmation: You will receive a shipping
                confirmation email with tracking details once your order has
                been dispatched. Why No Cancellation After Dispatch?: After
                dispatch, your order is in transit, and retrieving or
                redirecting it is not feasible. This policy helps us ensure
                efficient and timely delivery of orders to all customers.
