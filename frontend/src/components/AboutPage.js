                We are dedicated to spreading the word of God through our wide
                range of Christian books, doctrines, Bibles, diaries, and
                Christian stationery items. At Rehoboth, we believe that
                everyone should have access to the teachings and wisdom found in
                these spiritual resources. That’s why we sell all our products
                at zero margin, ensuring that cost is never a barrier to
                discovering and embracing God’s word. Our mission is to inspire,
                uplift, and bring hope to people everywhere by making these
                precious resources accessible to all. Join us in our journey to
                share the light of faith and knowledge.
